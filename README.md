## Problem definition:
We have a medical claim dataset, each row represents a patient, while each row 
represents a medical service or a personal information. 

## The main targets are:
1. Apply a technique for classifying whether each patient (row) implies normal or 
fraud behavior (might be ML pipeline or other statistical approach). Note, we 
expect only 1 ML algorithm for classification.
2. Apply un unsupervised ML pipeline for anomaly detection based given the fact 
that there are no labels for the claims (you can apply other statistical approach 
instead), we expect only 1 ML algorithm.
